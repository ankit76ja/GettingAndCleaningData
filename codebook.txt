Some of the given aspects which were given to us as the base for starting yhis projects are below:
I have also described after this what we have to filter out from all this.

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

We got the following estimate on all the obtained measure

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation
mad(): Median absolute deviation 
max(): Largest value in array
min(): Smallest value in array
sma(): Signal magnitude area
energy(): Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values. 
iqr(): Interquartile range 
entropy(): Signal entropy
arCoeff(): Autorregresion coefficients with Burg order equal to 4
correlation(): correlation coefficient between two signals
maxInds(): index of the frequency component with largest magnitude
meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency
skewness(): skewness of the frequency domain signal 
kurtosis(): kurtosis of the frequency domain signal 
bandsEnergy(): Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window.
angle(): Angle between to vectors.


But out of all these what we are interested in is the mean and standard deviation of the features.Byy filtering the features having mean and standard deviation,we got the following features which are 79

The number of subject is 30 and the number of activity is 6 

"1" "WALKING"
"2" "WALKING_UPSTAIRS"
"3" "WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS"
"4" "SITTING"
"5" "STANDING"
"6" "LAYING"

The task we have been given is to calculate the average of each measurement for each subject and each activity

For example for the subject 3rd doing the activity walking , we have to calculate the average of fBodyGyro_mean_X.


The tidy data sets obtained after this would have 79 features as the rownames and column names as the concanated form like activity_subject name

For example : if you want to get the average of fBodyGyro_std_Y for the subject 4th doing the activity Sitting ,the column have name Sitting_4 and row name fBodyGyro_std_Y
